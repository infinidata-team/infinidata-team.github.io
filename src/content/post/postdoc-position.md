## Summary
We are searching for a motivated postdoctoral researcher to lead the research and development of dataset discovery and data augmentation, and scalable ML training and inference in data lakes. 
You will be working alongside a team of excellent PhD & MSc students, and taking part in funding opportunities, in order to build a strong academic CV.

## Details
Data-driven enterprises nowadays need to discover, combine and analyze data at the petabyte scale. 
Data discovery aims at finding a subset of relevant datasets from a data lake that can be combined together and enable deep insights to a given question. 
Dataset discovery is one of the most intensively discussed data management challenges for big data. 
The current approaches mostly search for datasets with similar attribute names or overlapping instance values, handling tabular data or hierarchical data that can be transformed into tabular data. 
The challenges include finding joinable tables or semantically related tables. 
As part of the Web Information Systems (WIS) section, the data management team at TU Delft is interested in tackling exciting challenges of supporting common data science tasks, such as finding additional data for training or validation, and feature engineering. For more research details, please refer to our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09681">vision article </a>

The candidate is expected to lead a team in order to develop a novel data discovery system that integrates human knowledge and analytical goals with dataset characteristics, metadata, and quality. The duties of the postdoctoral researcher include authoring top-tier conference papers, supervising master and PhD students, and design or development of open-source data discovery tools.

We are looking for a motivated candidate to join our data management group (Dr. Rihan Hai, Dr. Asterios Katsifodimos). You will be part of a very motivated and vibrant group of researchers. Following TU Delft’s multi-annual strategy 2022-2025, 'health' is now a core domain focus for our faculty and we support young researchers pursuing their next career goals.


## Requirements
•	You are a highly motivated, independent, and enthusiastic researcher (F/M) with the ambition to conduct high-quality, interdisciplinary research bridging qualitative and quantitative methods;
•	You have a PhD in Data management, Data Science, data analytics, Machine learning or a related discipline;
•	You are fluent in English and have good communication skills (essential);
•	You thrive in a collaborative and multidisciplinary environment and look forward to interacting with researchers and experts in different domains;
•	You have experience in developing software tools or systems.

## Join Us:
