## Abstract

Quantum computing has emerged as a transformative tool for future data management. Classical problems in database domains, including query optimization, data integration, and transaction management, have recently been addressed using quantum computing techniques. This tutorial aims to establish the theoretical foundation essential for enhancing methodologies and practical implementations in this line of research. Moreover, this tutorial takes a forward-looking approach by delving into recent strides in quantum internet technologies and the nonlocality theory. We aim to shed light on the uncharted territory of future data systems tailored for the quantum internet.
